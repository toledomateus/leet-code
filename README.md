##  List problems

### 1. Always take advantage of sorted list.

I know this could sound reduntant but if the problem gives you the array sorted, take the advantage of it and optmize your solution in your first try it.

### 2. Use the pointers given to you

If the exercise gives to you some pointers for the arrays don't forgives to look foward them. Also, try always to see how you can manipulate pointers when you're using extra pointers.

### 3. Make sure if you need to check all the list

Use for if yes, while if not.

### 4. If you are comparing 2 strings and you have to count something, try to resolve by a hashmap.

For instance, see it if it's possible to form a specific string with the reference string, and so on. Possible you can use a hashmap to compare and you can avoid make a nested for looking into 2 list.
