##  List problems

### 1. Always take advantage of sorted list.

I know this could sound reduntant but if the problem gives you the array sorted, take the advantage of it and optmize your solution in your first try it.

### 2. Use the pointers given to you

If the exercise gives to you some pointers for the arrays don't forgives to look foward them. Also, try always to see how you can manipulate pointers when you're using extra pointers.
